# Rocket Calendar 🚀🗓️

Welcome to RocketCalendar!

RocketCalendar is an NPM package developed with TypeScript that aims to provide a user-friendly and highly customizable date picker for projects that require a more intuitive calendar UI than the native browser date picker.

This package is in an early stage of development, but we are excited to share it with the community and welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community.

If you are interested in using RocketCalendar in your project or just want to contribute to the development, please feel free to explore our source code and submit a pull request with your improvements. We would love to have your help in making RocketCalendar the best date selection tool you can have!

Thank you for your interest in RocketCalendar, and we look forward to collaborating with you in the future.
